# C

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.

The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow primitives: 

* if/else

* for

* do/while

* while

* switch. 

User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil.

Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including [Python](/wiki/Python).

It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise, and logic operators: +,+=,++,&,||, etc.
